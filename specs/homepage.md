2. Talk to Their Pain

Headline:
You have the vision, but tech feels overwhelming.

Body Copy:
I get it. You know your business, your customers, and your dream… but once words like MVP, frameworks, hosting, or databases show up, it’s easy to freeze.

That’s where I come in. My job is to make sure you don’t waste money or months trying to figure this out alone.

3. Your Role for Them

Headline:
I’m your tech co-pilot.

Body Copy:
Think of me as your part-time CTO — without the big salary.

I’ll help you shape your idea into something we can actually build.

I’ll create the first version (your MVP) so you can test it with real customers.

I’ll guide you on the right tools so you don’t overpay or overcomplicate.

And when you’re ready to grow, we’ll scale it together.

4. Why You Can Trust Me

Headline:
I’ve been building tech for 20 years.

Body Copy:
I’ve worked with startups, scale-ups, and even Fortune 500 companies. Over the years, I’ve:

Built booking platforms, advertising dashboards, and SaaS products.

Helped founders avoid expensive mistakes with the wrong tech.

Worked with tools like React, Node.js, TypeScript, and Elixir to create modern, reliable apps.

Bottom line? I know what it takes to go from idea → launch.
